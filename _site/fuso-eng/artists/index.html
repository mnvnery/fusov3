                <div class="artist-bio"><p>Alia Syed was born in Swansea, Wales and lives between London and Glasgow. She has been making experimental films in Britain for over 25 years. Alia Syed's films examine memory, representation and colonialism through narratives constructed from personal and historical realities. Her two most recent works combine her interest in storytelling with a compelling presentation of history as a visual narrative; using diverse subjectivities to reframe both the time flow of the river Thames and the regeneration of the city of Glasgow respectively. Her unique approach sutures different subjective positions in relation to culture, diaspora, and location, specifically in relation to gender and notions of cultural difference. Syed’s films have been shown at numerous institutions around the world including BBC Arts Online (currently), The Triangle Space: Chelsea College of Arts (2014), Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2012-13, 5th Moscow Biennale (2013); Museum of Modern Art, New York (2010); Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid (2009); XV Sydney Biennale (2006); Hayward Gallery, London (2005); Tate Britain, London (2003); Glasgow Museum of Modern Art, Scotland (2002); Iniva, London (2002); The New Art Gallery in Walsall (2002); and Tate Modern, London (2000). Syed’s films have also been the subject of several solo exhibitions at Talwar Gallery in New York and New Delhi. She is represented by Talwar Gallery in New York and New Delhi and was nominated for the Jarman Award in 2015.</p></div>

                <div class="artist-bio"><p>Haroon Mirza has won international acclaim for installations that test the interplay and friction between sound and light waves and electric current. He devises sculptures, performances and immersive installations, such as <em>The National Apavillion of Then and Now</em> (2011) (Silver Lion at the 54th Venice Biennale) – an anechoic chamber with a circle of light that grows brighter in response to increasing drone, and completely dark when there is silence. He describes his role as a composer, manipulating electricity, a live, invisible and volatile phenomenon, to make it dance to a different tune and calling on instruments as varied as household electronics, vinyl and turntables, LEDs, furniture, video footage and existing artworks to behave differently. His work asks us to reconsider the perceptual distinctions between noise, sound and music. Mirza studied at Winchester School of Art, Goldsmiths College (2006) and Chelsea College of Art and Design (2007). Recent solo exhibitions have been held at CCA Kitakyushu, Kitakyushu, Japan (2020); John Hansard Gallery, Southampton, UK (2019); Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, Melbourne, Australia (2019); Sifang Art Museum, Nanjing, China (2019). In 2018, Haroon Mirza unveiled '<a href="https://www.ballroommarfa.org/archive/event/stone-circle/">Stone Circle</a>', a large-scale outdoor sculpture commissioned by Ballroom Marfa, Texas, which will remain in the landscape for five years. In 2021, Mirza’s <em>The National Apavilion of Then and Now </em>(2011)<em> </em>was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art, New York.</p></div>

In 2012 she completed the Independent Studies Program at Maumaus, in Lisbon.<br>In her work Norton addresses issues related to the binary natural / organic vs artificial / synthetic. In an approach of observation and recording of these two apparently antagonistic concepts, she explores her contemporary dialogues, points of intersection, dissonance and tension, taking them as the starting point of her artistic language, which naturally takes on other ramifications and questions.

                <div class="artist-bio"><p>Jan Fabre (Belgian, b.1958) is a visual artist, theatre artist and author who is considered as one of the most versatile and influential artists of his generation. He calls himself a consilience artist because he always leaps forward in knowledge through the linking of fact-based theory and practice across disciplines. He seeks and sees links between the different disciplines and for that reason he gave new interpretations to the world of visual arts, theatre and writing. The enchantment with ephemeral, unseen and cathartic in the work of Jan Fabre takes the central position. Those features are always framing the narrative and are omnipresent regardless of the media. Fabre has taken part in major international exhibitions, such as the Venice Biennale, documenta in Kassel, and the Istanbul Biennale. The acclaimed multidisciplinary artist still lives and works in his native Antwerp, where he also helms his own theatre company, Troubleyn.</p></div>

                <div class="artist-bio"><p>Johanna Billing, born in Sweden in 1973, lives and works in Stockholm. Johanna has been making video works since 1999 that weave together music, movement and rhythm. Merging the production modes of collective live events and workshops with a cinematic language, Billing in part directs the participants and in part activates a series of improvisations around the notion of performance and the possibility it holds to explore issues of the public and the private as well as the individual in the society as a whole. Billing often addresses political climates and cultural specificities, but more importantly she transforms, through a documentary method, her filmmaking in a fictive space to examine actual and contrived events and how that filmed compression illuminates their overlap. Billing’s films often involve music, which in her hands becomes a tool for communication, memory and reconstruction.</p></div>

In his work, Jungerman explores the intersection of pattern and symbol in Surinamese Maroon culture, the larger African diaspora, and 20th century Modernism, placing fragments of Maroon textiles and other materials found in the African diaspora—the kaolin clay used in several religious traditions or the nails featured in Nkisi Nkondi power sculpture—in direct contact with materials and imagery drawn from more “established” art traditions, Jungerman presents a peripheral vision that both enriches and informs our perspective on art history. <br>Jungerman represented the Netherlands at the 58th Venice Biennale in 2019. Jungerman is co-founder and curator of the Wakaman Project, drawing Lines – connecting dots. Wakaman, which means “walking man,” was born out of a desire to examine the position of visual artists of Surinamese origin and to raise their profile(s) on the international stage. He has exhibited works internationally including at: 58th Venice Biennial, Dutch Pavilion, IT; Prospect3, New Orleans; Brooklyn Museum, New York, El Museo del Barrio, New York, Jack Shainman Gallery, New York, US; Rennie Museum, Vancouver, CA; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Museum Arnhem; Fridman Gallery, New York; Goodman Gallery, London; Havana Biennale; Museum Bamako, Mali; Museum Tromso, Norway; Künstlerhaus Bethanien, Berlin, DE; Badischer Kunstverein, Karlsruhe.</p></div>
