                <div class="artist-bio"><p>Alia Syed was born in Swansea, Wales and lives between London and Glasgow. She has been making experimental films in Britain for over 25 years. Alia Syed's films examine memory, representation and colonialism through narratives constructed from personal and historical realities. Her two most recent works combine her interest in storytelling with a compelling presentation of history as a visual narrative; using diverse subjectivities to reframe both the time flow of the river Thames and the regeneration of the city of Glasgow respectively. Her unique approach sutures different subjective positions in relation to culture, diaspora, and location, specifically in relation to gender and notions of cultural difference. Syed’s films have been shown at numerous institutions around the world including BBC Arts Online (currently), The Triangle Space: Chelsea College of Arts (2014), Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2012-13, 5th Moscow Biennale (2013); Museum of Modern Art, New York (2010); Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid (2009); XV Sydney Biennale (2006); Hayward Gallery, London (2005); Tate Britain, London (2003); Glasgow Museum of Modern Art, Scotland (2002); Iniva, London (2002); The New Art Gallery in Walsall (2002); and Tate Modern, London (2000). Syed’s films have also been the subject of several solo exhibitions at Talwar Gallery in New York and New Delhi. She is represented by Talwar Gallery in New York and New Delhi and was nominated for the Jarman Award in 2015.</p></div>

Currently, she is bringing photography and video together in installations.</p></div>

From an early age, he was fascinated by the possible worlds outside this world and, at the age of 7, he told his primary school teacher that he wanted to be a diver like Jacques Cousteau or a scientist like Carl Sagan. <br>Despite his talent for diving, he had not been aware of the beauty that exists in a mathematical equation. Thus, a few years later, he decided to graduate in Audiovisual and Multimedia Communication Sciences, because he believed that in television and cinema all worlds are possible. After he completed the course, he worked as assistant director in some series, realizing that glamour on TV only exists in tabloids. He then decided to be a biologist and returned to university to fulfil this goal, resulting in the publication of his first and only scientific article. In 2015 he began working with art and with contemporary artists, thrilled by the possibilities of encountering other worlds and other universes.</p></div>

                <p class="text-uppercase artist-name">Remy Jungerman</p>
                <div class="artist-bio"><p>Remy Jungerman (1959), one of the most important artists in the Netherlands, attended the Academy for Higher Arts and Cultural Studies in Paramaribo, Surinam, before moving to Amsterdam where he studied at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy. In his work, Jungerman explores the intersection of pattern and symbol in Surinamese Maroon culture, the larger African diaspora, and 20th century Modernism, placing fragments of Maroon textiles and other materials found in the African diaspora—the kaolin clay used in several religious traditions or the nails featured in Nkisi Nkondi power sculpture—in direct contact with materials and imagery drawn from more “established” art traditions, Jungerman presents a peripheral vision that both enriches and informs our perspective on art history.<br>Jungerman represented the Netherlands at the 58th Venice Biennale in 2019. Jungerman is co-founder and curator of the Wakaman Project, drawing Lines – connecting dots. Wakaman, which means “walking man,” was born out of a desire to examine the position of visual artists of Surinamese origin and to raise their profile(s) on the international stage. He has exhibited works internationally including at: 58th Venice Biennial, Dutch Pavilion, IT; Prospect3, New Orleans; Brooklyn Museum, New York, El Museo del Barrio, New York, Jack Shainman Gallery, New York, US; Rennie Museum, Vancouver, CA; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Museum Arnhem; Fridman Gallery, New York; Goodman Gallery, London; Havana Biennale; Museum Bamako, Mali; Museum Tromso, Norway; Künstlerhaus Bethanien, Berlin, DE; Badischer Kunstverein, Karlsruhe.</p></div>
