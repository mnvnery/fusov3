He studied Graphic Communication at La Chambre and his work is inspired by Dumas, Orozco, Basquiat, and Kapoor. He made his first films in 1997 and directed several short films, and installations: Friday, June 18 (1999), City of London (1999), Man Walking (2004), Atomic Tree (2006), Woman Walking (2006), Inner Eclipse (2012), Guide de politesse à l’attention de nos forces de l’ordre (2014).</p>

                <div class="artist-bio"><p>Lothar Hempel was born in 1966. He lives and works in Cologne. He draws his inspiration from German history, Californian New Wave, Greek tragedy, pagan culture, music, and cinema. What matters to him is not the reference as such — taken for what it is or for what it conveys in today’s Western society — but a re-appropriation of these images and this reality to circulate within his individual universe, taking possession of them and thus creating a series of possibilities for specific interpretations by each individual person, in a journey between reality and dream.</p>

                <div class="artist-bio"><p>Teun Hocks – The Netherlands (1947-2022)</p>

<p>The author of a small theater of the strange, Teun Hocks writes stories without plot and creates untitled paintings, allowing the viewer to freely interpret the meaning - or rather the nonsense - of the images presented to them. His physical omnipresence does not mean he is imposing. He gives us the possibility to inhabit his works, temporarily absenting himself from them, as in the video where he clings to a chandelier swinging back and forth endlessly, intermittently forced to leave the camera’s field of vision and that of our gaze.</p>

                <div class="artist-bio"><p>Alexandre Perigot, born in 1959, lives and works in Paris. Through videos, installations, music, and dance, Perigot works to uncover the signs of the society of the spectacle. The territory of his works is situated in the turbulence of the interface between social space and the constitution of the singular self. Attuned to the reality of the world and its multiple manifestations in our society, he is constantly aware of the illusory mechanisms of identification: how do we let ourselves be seduced by celebrity? The models of representing reality, especially through video games, influence our behavior in our daily lives? Is it possible that we use the larger-than-life persona that we often assign to celebrities as a template for constructing our own identity?</p>

                <div class="artist-bio"><p>La Ribot, born in 1962 in Madrid, lives and works in Spain and Switzerland. She is a renowned artist who works internationally. She studied classical dance in Madrid from the age of thirteen and embraced performance and contemporary dance in the mid-80s. She worked initially in Cannes with Rosella Hightower and then in Germany and New York. Upon returning to Madrid, she created her first piece in 1985, Carita de Ángel. The following year, she founded the Bocanada Danza group with Blanca Calvo, which dissolved in 1989. In the early 90s, she choreographed her first solo work, Socorro! Gloria!, which takes the form of a humorous cabaret show: thus La Ribot was born.</p>

                <div class="artist-bio"><p>Manfred Sternjakob, born in 1955, lives and works in Germany. He is a video artist whose works are pictorial compositions that stand out for their movement. Influenced by his childhood spent in West Germany and by the American education that shaped him, Manfred Sternjakob weaves references taken from these two cultures which nourish his vivid paintings.</p>

                <div class="artist-bio"><p>Claudia Triozzi began her studies in classical and contemporary dance in Italy, before moving to Paris in 1985. In addition to her work as a performer (with Odile Duboc, Georges Appaix, François Verret, Alain Buffard, Xavier Leroy and Xavier Boussiron), she creates her own pieces as a theatre director and performer. Her research work is based on transmission, in which the experience of doing, sharing, and committing to others opens up spaces for subjectivity and a different configuration of time.</p>
