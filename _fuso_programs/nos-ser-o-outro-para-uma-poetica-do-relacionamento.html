  A selection of recent commissions and distributed work from LUX, the UK agency
  for the support and promotion of artists working with the moving image,
  exploring ideas of belonging, particularly in the English landscape, against
  the backdrop of the UK government’s antagonistic relationship with its migrant
  communities.


  During the COVID-19 pandemic – as people realised anew the importance of nature and open spaces for our health and mental wellbeing – inequalities of access to rural land were being exposed, revealing the disconnect felt by millions of people towards the English countryside. 


  A 2019 government review found that many Black, Asian and ethnically diverse people view the countryside as an ‘irrelevant white, middle-class club’, concluding that this divide is only going to widen as society changes and ‘the countryside will end up being irrelevant to the country that actually exists’.
