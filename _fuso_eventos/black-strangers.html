  Dan Guthrie’s black strangers seeks a man called ‘Daniel’ recorded on a
  bishop’s transcript held in Gloucestershire Archives, who was buried in
  Nympsfield in 1719 and described as ‘a black stranger’. 


  Whilst walking, Dan talks directly to Daniel, speculating about the parallels between him and his namesake, and about how his experience in his hometown of Stroud mirrors that of ‘Daniel’.
