I"®<p>La Ribot, born in 1962 in Madrid, lives and works in Spain and Switzerland. She is a renowned artist who works internationally. She studied classical dance in Madrid from the age of thirteen and embraced performance and contemporary dance in the mid-80s. She worked initially in Cannes with Rosella Hightower and then in Germany and New York. Upon returning to Madrid, she created her first piece in 1985, Carita de √Ångel. The following year, she founded the Bocanada Danza group with Blanca Calvo, which dissolved in 1989. In the early 90s, she choreographed her first solo work, Socorro! Gloria!, which takes the form of a humorous cabaret show: thus La Ribot was born.</p>
