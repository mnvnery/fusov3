I"w<p>A new kaleidoscope</p>

<p>For its 5th edition, FUSO INSULAR presents a new kaleidoscope of utopian, dystopian, political and above all poetic images, which characterizes the proposals made under the FUSO Lisboa Open Call in 2023, competition open to national and foreign artists living in Portugal.</p>

<p>More than 250 videos participated in the Open Call. From the difficult choice among so many proposals, the twelve selected demonstrate the diversity of the Portuguese artistic panorama. The projects translate into images, words, sounds and bodies the issues that cut across our societies.</p>

<p>Let us listen and dwell on the vibrations of these promises, these fragile plants that flourish in between the ruins. Let us welcome this sometimes-disconcerting plurality of looks that are open to the multiplication of possibilities and the construction of new imaginaries.</p>
