I"Y<p>Teun Hocks – The Netherlands (1947-2022)</p>

<p>The author of a small theater of the strange, Teun Hocks writes stories without plot and creates untitled paintings, allowing the viewer to freely interpret the meaning - or rather the nonsense - of the images presented to them. His physical omnipresence does not mean he is imposing. He gives us the possibility to inhabit his works, temporarily absenting himself from them, as in the video where he clings to a chandelier swinging back and forth endlessly, intermittently forced to leave the camera’s field of vision and that of our gaze.</p>
