I"J<p>A city with 20 million inhabitants.<br />
Everyone has to commute and use cars as their main means of transportation. In addition to the large number of people driving, they also have a very peculiar traffic code. Rules created by the drivers themselves. They use honks and glances in the rearview mirrors to communicate with each other.Â There is no silence, drivers honk day and night. In this video we can hear around 581 honks, transporting us to another reality. Focusing on the sensory experience, sight and hearing are awakened. Noise is one of the keywords for the work.</p>
