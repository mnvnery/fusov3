I"ç<p>Sofia Santa-Rita, born in Lisbon in 1994, holds a degree in Communication Design (2017) and a master in Contemporary Typographic and Editorial Practices (2023) from FBAUL, with projects in the field of concrete poetry and video-poems. Defining herself as a multidisciplinary artist, she has a penchant for the paradoxical nature of things, focusing mainly on the image/text relationship, combining poetry, writing and lyrics with photography and video. Endowed with a very flagrant sensory aspect, her work is born from the need to fill the gap between herself and the other. The genesis and consequently the culmination of her work is found in the impetus to tell stories, finding in cinema her current focus and ultimate inspiration.</p>
