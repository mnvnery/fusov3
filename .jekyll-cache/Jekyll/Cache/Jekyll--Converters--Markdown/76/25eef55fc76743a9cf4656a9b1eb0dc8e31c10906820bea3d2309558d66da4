I"L<p>The utopia of peace is a floating “island”, an unfortunate one, on the map of human history of all the wars.</p>
<p>Susana Gaudêncio starts from the observation of a specific housing typology at the city of Porto called "Ilhas" (islands), for a reflection on the colonial question, which Maria Lusitano, in turn, treats with critical humor and abundant documentation on the film “Nostalgia”.</p>
<p>In a manifestly darker tone, Daniel Barroca fragments the perception of the body and of the territories of war until they dissolve into abstraction. Salome Lamas gives voice to a rather young mercenary whose profession was to kill at the command of very corrupt groups, and Jan Fabre, in this film, depicts the inner struggle of a medieval knight fighting his inner demons.</p>
<p>Fighting seems to be the human condition, but the object of these fights is almost always a sign of a regrettable deviation from what could have been the essential purpose of the experience of life: consciousness linked to self-discovery, to the understanding of the universe and a collective construct.</p>
