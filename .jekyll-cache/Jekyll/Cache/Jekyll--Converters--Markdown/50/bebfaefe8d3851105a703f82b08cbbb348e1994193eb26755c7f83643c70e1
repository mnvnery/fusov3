I"§<p>Rhea Storr explores Black and Mixed-race cultural representation with an interest in the in-between, the culturally ineffable, translation, format and aesthetics. She is concerned with performance, costume and the politics of masquerade. In particular she has employed carnival as a means to articulate a complex relationship between Britain and the Caribbean that underlines the importance of location. She also images Black and Mixed-race bodies in rural spaces. Often working in photochemical film, Rhea Storr considers counter-cultural ways of producing moving-image. Selected exhibitions/screenings include: BFI London Film Festival, Artistsâ€™ Film International, Hamburg International Short Film Festival, European Media Art Festival, Museum of African American History and Culture and Somerset House and Lisson Gallery. She is the winner of the Aesthetica Art Prize 2020 and the Louis Le Prince Experimental Film Prize.</p>
