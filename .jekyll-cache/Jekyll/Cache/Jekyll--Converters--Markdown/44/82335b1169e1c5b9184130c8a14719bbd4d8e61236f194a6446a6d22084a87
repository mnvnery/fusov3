I"ý<p>Claudia Triozzi began her studies in classical and contemporary dance in Italy, before moving to Paris in 1985. In addition to her work as a performer (with Odile Duboc, Georges Appaix, FranÃ§ois Verret, Alain Buffard, Xavier Leroy and Xavier Boussiron), she creates her own pieces as a theatre Diretor and performer. Her research work is based on transmission, in which the experience of doing, sharing, and committing to others opens up spaces for subjectivity and a different configuration of time.</p>
