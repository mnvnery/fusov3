I"´<p>Interweaving documentary tropes with the aesthetics of contemporary Hollywood cinema, Humores Artificiais, a film that was originally conceived for the 32nd Bienal de SÃ£o Paulo â€“ Incerteza Viva (2016), follows a young indigenous girl on a journey from her village in the Xingu National Park in Mato Grosso â€“the first ever indigenous land to be ratified by the federal government, which was artificially created for them in 1961 with the objective of preserving an idealized notion of indigenous culture â€“ to SÃ£o Paulo, where she falls in love with the outlandish robot Andy Coughman. The film touches on themes such as the relationship between artificial intelligence and humanization, the anthropology of humor and laughter, scientific knowledge and ancestral wisdom, nature and technology, capitalism and contemporary society, artificial consciousness, and human emotion while discussing post-colonial, gender and identity issues.</p>
