I"r<p>Sara Massa was born in São Miguel, but doesn’t like orange juice. She likes to be busy doing random things and finding out new thigs. She is 21 years old and studies Visual Arts. For her, discovering new visual ways of interpreting life is pleasant; since she was a little girl art has been a refuge from reality where everything is possible, a utopian world.</p>
