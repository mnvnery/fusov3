I"7<p>Invited to take part in 2023’s Fuso— International Video Art Festival, the year in which it celebrates its 15th anniversary, Serralves Museum has selected two films from its collection which will be shown in a single session at São Jorge Castle, by the museum’s chief curator, Inês Grosso. Medium-length features by artists Gabriel Abrantes, and Rivane Neuenschwander in collaboration with Mariana Lacerda, have complex, turbulent Brazil - from the years preceding the last government until the recent reelection of Lula da Silva - as backdrop and also jumping-off point for discussing some of the political, social and historical themes that have been at the heart of present-day debate, such as issues related to gender, indigenous peoples, the environment, post-colonialism, the ancestral and capitalism.</p>
