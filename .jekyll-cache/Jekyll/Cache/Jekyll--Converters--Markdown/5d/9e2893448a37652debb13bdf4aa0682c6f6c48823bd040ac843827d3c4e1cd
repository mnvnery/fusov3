I"ÿ<p>The LaboratÃ³rio Imagem em Movimento (Moving Image Lab) is the FUSO INSULAR Creative Residency Programme, whose purpose is to give people who live in the Azoresâ€”whether they are artists or notâ€”and are interested in the cinematographic arts, the opportunity to make their own video projects. The Lab provides content and references and offers support for the development and direction of their work.</p>

<p>For three months, during the Azorean summer, the eight participants of the LaboratÃ³rio 2023â€”Anita Nemet, Carolina Rocha, Elliot Sheedy, Fernando Nunes, Gustavo Fernandes, LuÃ­s Brum, TAT, and Tiago Correiaâ€”met with artists Daniel Blaufuks and AndrÃ© Laranjinha to reflect on moving image as an artistic expression that cuts across all practices. They wrote scripts, captured images and sounds, ventured into editing practice in search of how to tell a storyâ€”their story. The result is films that move between physical and emotional territories, offering a poetic yet critical view of the society in which we live.</p>

<p>What is the common thread between a dream, a ciranda, an ode to the community in the form of visual poetry, self-searching, the pain of a war, and intense images of beauty in the contemporary world?Â </p>

<p>The 4th edition of the LaboratÃ³rio Imagem em Movimento presents a collection of video narratives that explore various languages: performance, dance, experimental cinema, photography, literature, and digital arts, thereby showcasing the diversity of the Azorean art scene in their creations.</p>

<p>The films will be screened in the presence of their creators at the Black Box of the ArquipÃ©lago - Centro de Artes ContemporÃ¢neas, a space and a team that play a crucial role in the execution of the FUSO INSULAR residency programme.</p>
