I"ı<p>The ‚Äúcegadas‚Äù are short plays written and performed by members of the community from Nazar√© (PT) and are presented during the carnival balls. In the months leading up to Carnival, it is normal for these groups to get together in spaces like parking garages to discuss and rehearse the scripts - often focused on local social critique or stories from the past - and the songs that are performed between the scenes, which are usually sung a cappella or accompanied by a single guitar. One of these groups was challenged to enter a TV studio in order to convert an excerpt from their play into a commercial product, and as the studio is revealed, a new approach to the traditional aesthetics of these performances is also introduced to the public.</p>
