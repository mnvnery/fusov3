I"<p>Ar.Co - Centro de Arte e ComunicaÃ§Ã£o is proposing, for this yearâ€™s edition of FUSO â€“ Lisbon International video Art Festival, a selection of four works directed by students from the Cinema / Moving Image Course. These videos are like open maps that compose a cartography of unknown and intimate territories, using both georeferencing coordinates and sensory approaches to map affective spaces.<br />
In Falha #72, by Ricardo Grelha, we are led by a voyeuristic gaze, lost in psychedelic delusions. In Boa Noite, InÃªs FalcÃ£o offers an expanded love letter dedicated to those who share with her the intimacy of surrendering to sleep. Uncomfortable Positions, by Frances Rocha, is a poetic journey through an archive of photographs of medical appointments; and Stephanie Kyek, in Mapping Blanca, leads us through a sound journey that (re)materializes the mapped landscape.<br />
Most of these short films use images from found footage to transport us on their cinematic journey, a wild journey across clues preserved in multiple archives.</p>
