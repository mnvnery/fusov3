I":<p>You are my Sister (Turning) is Atlas’s powerful visual interpretation of the song of the same name by the acclaimed musician Anohni, formerly known as Antony of Antony &amp; the Johnsons. Anohni’s haunting vocals are paired with Atlas’s digitally processed, close-up portraits of, in Atlas’s words, thirteen “NYC Beauties”—thirteen trans women from New York’s East Village who tell their personal stories of struggle and survival. The portraits, turning in hypnotic motion, were originally recorded, processed, and projected live by Atlas during the performance piece Turning, a collaborative stage project by Atlas and Antony. In 2014 the lush visuals of You Are My Sister were projected at midnight on 37 giant screens in the heart of New York’s Times Square as part of the Midnight Moment program.</p>
