I"<<p>These last few years have been difficult for all of us. First a plague, then conflict and war. History always repeats itself with the resulting challenges increasing in intensity. So, bearing this in mind, we have to adapt, to develop a new conscience, and create empathy. Nevertheless, we carry on believing that the World can still be fixed. So, based on the Modernist notion that history is formed upon progress and overcoming the odds—even when we have legitimate doubts—we must remain positive.</p>
<p>In this context, we hope you can join us for an informal discussion about the ideas that guide this year's festival: RESILIENCE, HOPE, COMMUNITY.</p>
<p>Following our get together, we bring you the DJ trio 'Mão na Anca' (Isabel Nogueira, Raquel Castro and Patrícia Barnabé), for socializing and having fun.</p>
