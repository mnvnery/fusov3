I"»<p>Gustavo FernandesÂ was born in the cradle of basalt on the Madeira Islands. The winds, Atlantic currents, and the embrace of the island of Pico all contributed to infuse life into him. Molded by the demands of computer engineering, he became a defector from formalism due to an innate hyperesthesia that led him to embrace less formal modes of expression, whether through writing, sound, or audiovisuals. As a promoter of the project â€˜Ilhas Ã  Escuta - Paisagens Sonoras dos AÃ§oresâ€™ (Islands Listening â€“ Soundscapes of the Azores), Fernandes writes for the magazine 9 Bairros (Azores 2027) and collaborates on the project â€˜Rede de MemÃ³rias - As MÃ£os das Mulheres nesta VivÃªncia de IlhÃ©uâ€™ (Network of Memories - Womenâ€™s Hands in this Islanderâ€™s Experience). He is also a member of the team behind the publication Tramela Aberta, an initiative of the Corvo Vivo Association. However, despite it all, he remains simply an islander.</p>
