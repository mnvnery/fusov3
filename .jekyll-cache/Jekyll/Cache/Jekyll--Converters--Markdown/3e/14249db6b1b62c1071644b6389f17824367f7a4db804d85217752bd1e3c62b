I"<p>Beatriz Soares Dias is a queer choreographer and performer who has been questioning language through her body. She navigates between states of empowerment, resistance, intimacy, freedom and sexuality - reflections of her personal rediscoveries - seeking time as a power of (re)construction of her identity as a person and artist.<br />
Highlights collaborations with Companhia Olga Roriz, Wbmotion Kulturverein, Tamara Cubas, André de Campos, Maurícia | Neves, André Uerba, Diana de Sousa, Bruno Alexandre, Francisca Manuel, Mariana Magalhães and Teatro do Mar. She is a trainer at F.O.R. Dance Theatre, being interested in a reconfiguration of educational practices as potencies of change, proximity and manifest.
