I"ª<p>Sleep is what makes us be ourselves, is what allows us to process everything that happens while we are awake.Â <br />
Over time we learn to feel comfortable in different beds and allow ourselves to be vulnerable to those we share our bed with.Â This unconscious state, and being able to share it, is a beautiful thing. I write this love letter to that serene sensory moment and for all the people who share it with me.</p>
