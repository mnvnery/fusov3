I"<p>Alexandre Perigot, born in 1959, lives and works in Paris. Through videos, installations, music, and dance, Perigot works to uncover the signs of the society of the spectacle. The territory of his works is situated in the turbulence of the interface between social space and the constitution of the singular self. Attuned to the reality of the world and its multiple manifestations in our society, he is constantly aware of the illusory mechanisms of identification: how do we let ourselves be seduced by celebrity? The models of representing reality, especially through video games, influence our behavior in our daily lives? Is it possible that we use the larger-than-life persona that we often assign to celebrities as a template for constructing our own identity?</p>
