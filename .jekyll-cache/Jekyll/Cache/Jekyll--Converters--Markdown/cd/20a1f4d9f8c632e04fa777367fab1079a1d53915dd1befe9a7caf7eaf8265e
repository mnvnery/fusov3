I"$<p>A new kaleidoscope</p>

<p>For its fifteenth edition, Festival Fuso presents a new kaleidoscope of utopian, dystopian, political and above all poetic images. What characterizes the proposals made under the Open Call (rules of the game: works of less than 10 minutes created between 2021 and 2023) is a dynamic look at a post-pandemic world. More than in previous years, there is now a more personal, singular questioning.Â </p>

<p>The number of applications continues to grow (more than 250 in 2023): from the difficult choice among so many proposals, the twelve selected demonstrate the diversity of the Portuguese artistic panorama. For this new edition, the projects translate into images, letters, words, sounds and bodies the issues that cut across our societies.</p>

<p>Let us listen and dwell on the vibrations of these promises, these fragile plants that flourish in between the ruins. Let us welcome this sometimes-disconcerting plurality of looks that are open to the multiplication of possibilities and the construction of new imaginaries.</p>
